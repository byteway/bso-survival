<h2>Survival</h2>
<p><strong>Location</strong>: Zwolle, the Netherlands, district Westenholte</p>
<p>Every year, dedicated volunteers come together to organize a survival event in the district. The primary audience for this event consists of children from primary schools. These enthusiastic youngsters have the opportunity to enroll as a teams, with the guidance of a volunteer parent who serves as their coach. So, the teamâ€™s average age can range from 10 to 14 years old.</p>
<p>During each survival event, two volunteer referees play a crucial role. They oversee the enforcement of all rules throughout the event, ensuring fair play. Additionally, the referees are responsible for assigning scores to each team. At the end of the day, the referees deliver the final score for their event. This means that the position of all Teams for that survival is known. </p>
<p>The final score is determined by the Survival Officer On Duty. The award ceremony is done by an official.</p>
<p>Rather than managing survival scores using an Excel document, the goal is to digitize the scoring process by putting all scores online. Fortunately, the Westenholte District Committee already has a WordPress website in place. </p>

<h2>Solution proposal</h2>
<p>Build a WordPress <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/intro/what-is-a-plugin/" target="blank">plugin</a>, make use of all the advantages that come with using a WordPress plugin - instead of adding new behaviour to the website by changing the current WordPress Theme. The plugin has an administration part and a public part. In the administration part all Survival related data can be edited. The plugin contains <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes/" target="blank">shortcodes</a> that can be used in <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-pages" target="blank">WordPress pages</a>.</p>
